Arrest occured ~1:00am August 1st.

On July 30th I was working as a bike courier delivering food for Postmates. In the early afternoon my route took me by Washington and Sansome where AbolishICE was holding a block party. I was told I was welcome to join the party, that they were protesting ICE. There were also officers on the scene (afternoon Tuesday) and I spoke to them a bit. They said these block parties happen often and that these block parties usually last till Sunday before the police shut them down.

I finished my deliveries at 1:52am July 31st. I went home, slept in, ran some errands, and went back to the protest at 11:30pm Wednesday July 31st. Everyone at the protest was very friendly. They had food and a band playing. At midnight they set up karaoke.

The karaoke set-up was quite nice. There was an inflatable projector screen with an intake pump and an outtake hole, similar to a bouncy castle. In front of the screen was a table with a projector and a dj using a Windows PC and Youtube to play the songs. They were all plugged in to a gas generator. 

I went up for my turn at karaoke at ~1:00am. I queued up Santeria by Sublime and was given a megaphone. At this point the police lined up.

The policed lined up shoulder to shoulder across Washington street. They spanned the width of the street. They began walking forward and I started singing my song. One of the officers trampled the projector screen. I don't know the words to Santeria but I wanted to keep singing so I repeated the first verse. When the officers reached me they grabbed the megaphone and pushed me to the ground. At this point things become fuzzy, I'm not certain on the chronology of the 2 paragraphs worth of events.

At one point some officers kicked my knees in and pushed me to the ground on my back. I was in a matrix pose. I continue to repeatedly sing the first verse of Santeria. One of the officers yelled "stop resisting" and I yelled back "I'm not resisting. I'm just not cooperating". I believe my head hit the ground here. I am still singing. 

At one point some officers rolled me over on to my stomach and knelt on my lower back. Here they ziptied my hands. I am still singing. As they picked me up the zipties broke. I yelled some taunt about the officers not being able to cuff properly, I do not remember the exact phrasing. I am still singing. Some officers push me onto the ground face first. My head hits the ground. One of the officers shoved his knee into my ear, turning my head to the side and forcing it into the gravel. I am still singing.

Some officers shove me into the back of the truck with the other protestors that were arrested. The other protestors ask me to stop singing and I comply. We arrive at a police station. The protestors all get out, are ID'd, and processed. I do not have ID on me. When they ask me for my info I state "I refuse to identify myself". They lock me up in the truck alone. I start singing the first verse of Santeria.

Again I am unsure of the chronology of these next events: The officers leave me in the van for a time. I am still singing. They pull me from the van head first and attempt to take my picture. I roll over and again state "I refuse to be identified". I am still singing. We drive around. Park. Drive around park. I believe we stop at another police station and I'm removed again. I am still singing. I am still stating "I refuse to be identified" when they ask me to identify myself. I am brought to a hospital emergency room.

I am brought into the emergency room by two officers. One of the officers is shorter, The other has a mustache. I believe they are the arresting officers on my arrest ticket. An image of which I have submitted as evidence. One officer's badge number is 1924. The other officer's name is Guzman. I got this information from the Notice to Appear that was given to me when I left. It is ticket number SD0083805 and the name on the ticket is John Smith. I do end up giving my name. I watched the sheriff deputy write the name John Smith after I had given my name.

I am brought into the emergency room by two officers. I am still singing. A nurse takes my vitals. The two officers are with me. I am still handcuffed. I am still singing. I am brought in to another room. Here a doctor comes to take a look at me. He asks if I've done any drugs. I state no. He asks if my wrists are ok, I say the cuffs are too tight and they are bleeding and oozing pus, he asks me what I would like him to do, I state I would like my wrists bandaged, he asks me to please stop singing, I state I will stop singing if he will give a doctors order that bandages must be wrapped around my wrists while the handcuffs are on.

The doctor tells the officers my wrists must be bandages while the handcuffs are on, I stop singing, the officers remove my handcuffs with warning not to run, the doctor bandages my wrists, and handcuffs are put back on. I do not remember if blood was drawn or a drug test was performed. I do not remember one happening but I would be surprised if one did not occur.

Once the handcuffs were put back on I resumed singing. I am still singing when the officers load me back in the van. Pulling out of the hospital and the following drive is very rough with a lot of sharp turns. We stop at a red light. I am still singing. I yell out to the officer something along the lines of "Is that the best you can do". When we move on from the red light the ride from the back seat has returned to normal. At some point we get to the sherriff's department. I am still singing.

When I am brought in to the sherrif's department there are a couple of officers there to receive me. There is [NEUE-], the officer that later punches me in the face. He is between 5'8" and 5'11", under 180lbs, white, has short black hair that has been styled, and is clean shaven. There is [BIG BLACK OFFICER], the officer that later sprains my hand. He is 6'5", between 300 and 400lbs, dark brown skin, short hair, and a beard. There is [GRIZZLED OFFICER], this officer later participated in moving me to and from the different cells. He is 5'11", 180lbs, white, has no hair on his head, and has stubble. There is [LITHE OFFICER]
