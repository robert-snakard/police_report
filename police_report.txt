Arrest occured ~1:00am August 1st.

On July 30th I was working as a bike courier delivering food for Postmates. In the early afternoon my route took me by Washington and Sansome where AbolishICE was holding a block party. I was told I was welcome to join the party, that they were protesting ICE. There were also officers on the scene (afternoon Tuesday) and I spoke to them a bit. They said these block parties happen often and that these block parties usually last till Sunday before the police shut them down.

I finished my deliveries at 1:52am July 31st. I went home, slept in, ran some errands, and went back to the protest at 11:30pm Wednesday July 31st. Everyone at the protest was very friendly. They had food and a band playing. At midnight they set up karaoke.

The karaoke set-up was quite nice. There was an inflatable projector screen with an intake pump and an outtake hole, similar to a bouncy castle. T
